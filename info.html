            <h2> What are Bottle Bills? </h2>
            <p>
                Have you ever seen a small price amount on single-use bottles and cans?
                That small 5, 10, or maybe even 24 cent value you see is a result of Bottle Bills.
                Currently in place only in ten states in the US (but not worldwide), Bottle Bills 
                place a small, refundable deposit on beverage containers. Upon returning an empty 
                container to a redemption center, you can receive a few cents back!
                If you live in a Bottle Bill state but don't know where redemption centers are, Bye-Bye Bottles is the place to look!
