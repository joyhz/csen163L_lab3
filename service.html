            <h1> What is Bye-Bye Bottles? </h1>
            <p>
                Bye-Bye Bottles is an app to educate people about Bottle Bills and motivate them to recycle containers, 
                as well as a helper to locate bottle redemption centers near them. It's an app that people hopefully wouldn't need to use much
                for Bottle Bill information, and moreso an easy way to locate redemption centers near them.
